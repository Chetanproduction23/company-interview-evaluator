# 🏢 Company Interview Evaluator

This repository provides a structured set of interview questions and evaluation criteria to help software engineers assess a company’s engineering culture, technical maturity, and codebase quality **before joining**.

It helps identify **red flags** and spot **positive signs** in areas like SDLC, code quality, dev environment, testing practices, and team culture.

---

## 📋 How to Use

During your technical interview process, use the questions below to evaluate the company. For each, we've listed:

- ✅ Good signs – what strong answers sound like  
- ❌ Red flags – what weak or problematic answers look like  

Ask follow-up questions when needed to clarify vague or overly positive answers.
