# 🏢 Company Interview Evaluator

This repository provides a structured set of interview questions and evaluation criteria to help software engineers assess a company’s engineering culture, technical maturity, and codebase quality **before joining**.

It helps identify **red flags** and spot **positive signs** in areas like SDLC, code quality, dev environment, testing practices, and team culture.
